# Tamil-Character-Recogniztion

## About Project :
Handwritten Character Recognition is a concept which is used to recognize each individual numerals and characters of a specific language. Handwritten Character Recognition is      very useful for visual digitilalisation and it is also used in various fields. Handwritten Character Recognition is available for many languages, But unfortunately there isn’t       a proper working model that could help us to recognize Characters of Tamil Language yet. We are implementing the Handwritten Character Recognition model for Tamil Language         which consist of 156 unique characters using CNN which stands for convolutional neural network. The architecture which is being used for creating this model is VGG which           stands for Visual Geometry group.

## Convolutional Neural Network :
A Convolutional Neural Network ( ConvNet/CNN ) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input Image, Assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
Convolutional networks were inspired by the working of neurons in the brain where each neuron act as a node which transmits an electrical pulse via which the brain functions.
A CNN uses a system much like a multilayer perceptron that has been designed for reduced processing requirements.
The layers of a CNN consist of an input layer, an output layer and a hidden layer that includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers.
